from 尊重護理專業、別理白色護士鞋

美國疾管局教育臨床護理人員明確指出:
要理解到不要成為暴力事件中被直接攻擊的對象，是非常重要的。目擊者，旁觀者和同事所遭受情緒和心理創傷並不比受害人少。
Finally, it is important to realize that one does not need to be the direct target of a violent act to be affected by it. Witnesses, bystanders and coworkers often suffer emotional and psychological trauma no less significant than that of the victim.
這就是告訴我們:面對暴力，我們要團結並且要站出來!!!
